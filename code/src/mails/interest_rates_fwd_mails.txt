Thank you for reaching out regarding the interest rates on your commercial loan. As of today, the current interest rate for loan servicing is **5.2% fixed** for a 10-year term. However, we do offer flexible rate options depending on your credit profile and collateral.

Hi Mark,

I just received this response from John at XYZ Bank regarding the interest rates for our commercial loan. They are offering a **5.2% fixed rate** for a 10-year term. Could you review and advise on whether this is a competitive rate for us?

Thanks,
Jane

Hi Jane,

Thanks for forwarding this. A **5.2% fixed rate** for a 10-year term is fairly standard in the market right now. However, we may be able to negotiate a better rate or explore adjustable rate options if we provide additional financials or collateral.

Would you like me to reach out to XYZ Bank to negotiate, or should we look at other institutions as well?

Best,
Mark

Dear Ms. Smith,

Certainly! We offer a **variable rate starting at 4.8%**, which adjusts annually based on the prime rate. Additionally, we provide a **0.25% discount** for early repayment if done within the first five years.

I can prepare a detailed comparison sheet if that would be helpful.

Let me know how youâ€™d like to proceed.

Best,
John
