Subject: Inquiry About Interest Rate Adjustments

Dear Loan Servicing Team,

We recently noticed a change in the interest rate on our commercial loan account ending in 5678. Could you provide details on why the adjustment was made and whether it aligns with the agreed-upon terms?

Additionally, we would like to understand if there are options to refinance or lock in a lower rate. Please advise on the next steps.

Best regards,
John Doe
